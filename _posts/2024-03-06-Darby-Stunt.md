Everyone who loves the sport of professional wrestling was on the edge of their seats to witness Sting's final match at the *AEW Revolution* pay-per-view event in Greensboro, Misconsin. However, when daredevil athlete Darby Allin jumped off of a 100 ft ladder and landed on his back in the middle of a plane of tempered glass that was being held up by six steel folding chairs, this profane act of self-disregard woke something foul that had been festering under the cement foundations of the Metroma Dome.

Former AEW competitor Charles Montgomery Punk opined on the results of the unintended ritual.

"I tried to warn them after Jack Perry got slammed into a car windshield," stated the famous straight edge wrestling star. "That was one step away from having grave consequences. Now we're seeing the results of Tony Khan's negligence."

After we saw the many cuts on Darby Allin's bleeding back, the shards of glass that scattered around him after the impressive stunt seems to coalesce on their own, forming the shape of the evil creature. Fans at first thought the monster to be a part of the show, but once this ancient servant of Crygenylx, God of Glass began rampaging through the crowd, a panicked evacuation began. Thankfully, Hiroshi Tanahashi was in attendance, and was able to heroically dispatch the abomination, and stabilize the fallen fans. While many were injured and are still hospitalized after the incident, there are not expected to be any casualties.

When contacted for to comment on the issue, Jack Perry said, "Summoning an ancient demon? Cry me a river."
